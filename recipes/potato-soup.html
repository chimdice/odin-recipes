        <p>
            To create this masterpiece of a potato soup, you are going to need to do a few things.
            First, you must cook the bacon until it is crispy. Then you must cook the soup.
            Cook onions, celery, and garlic in bacon grease. Add in chopped potatos and other veggies
            to the soup. Then add your cooked bacon. In a separate pan, create a cream mixture which
            you'll add to your main pot. Now you have got your soup
        </p>

            <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

        <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
            <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
            <li>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
